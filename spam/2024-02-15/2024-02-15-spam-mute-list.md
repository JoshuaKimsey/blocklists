## Your Instance Should not be here?
If you're the admin of an instance listed here and you've taken care of the spam issue and do not think what we wrote about your instance here is accurate, or you do not know why you're on this list at all, please message me on Matrix (*[ErikUden:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@erikuden:matrix.org)*) or E-Mail (*[fedi-spam@uden.ai](mailto:fedi-spam@uden.ai)*). I sincerely apologize for putting you on here and causing trouble!

### Special thanks to:

## The Mute List

**Download and import the updated list of instances observed to have spam to mute:** [Download Here](https://github.com/Mastodon-DE/blocklists/blob/main/spam/2024-02-15/2024-02-15-spam-domain_mutes-erik-uden.csv). 
*This includes all instances with a threat level of 1-5*.
*This list is about 20% of what instances we currently have reported, we are working on getting every instance on here (2024-02-18 | 14:37 GMT+1)*.
Note that while all instances can be imported with one click, in order to remove them once the spam is over you'll need to remove them all individually. 

You can simply import that list by going to https://yourinstance.tld/admin/export_domain_blocks/new just replace `yourinstance.tld` with the domain of the instance you are an admin of. 

Alternatively press on `Settings => Moderation => Federation => Import` to import this list. 
Note that it only makes sense to import this list and mute the spam instances if you've blocked spam locally and sustainably as described [here](https://mastodon.de/@ErikUden/111940301222380638). 

REMEMBER THAT DEFEDERATION WITH ANY INSTANCES IS A HARMFUL ACT AS IT SILENTLY REMOVES ALL FOLLOWERS FROM AND TO THAT INSTANCE FROM YOURS WHICH CANNOT BE UNDONE. Prefer limiting (*i.e. muting*) instances over defederating from them entirely! 

***Explanation/Glossary:***

**Threat level: the higher the worse of a threat the instance is**

- *Threat Level 0:* These instances were on the list but admins have since taken action and sustainably removed spam. They are listed under "Refederate with // Spam stopped".
- *Threat Level 1:* These instances have observed to have had spam, but are currently down and we cannot say for certain whether the spam has been sustainably stopped by the admins or if it will continue once the instance turns on again. 
- *Threat Level 2:* These instances had spam but no longer send out spam posts, old spam posts are still stored on the instance, however. This could be because the admins took action preventing spammers from creating accounts and hence removing spam sustainably, or because the spammers simply decided to stop targeting their instance. If that was the case the spam could start any moment if the spammers decide to do so. 
- *Threat Level 3:* These instances are observed to currently send out spam posts. 
- *Threat Level 4:* These instances were observed to have spam, were re-classified to be safe, but then the spam began again meaning either a new wave / kind of spam has infected this instance or the admins did not take measures to sustainably prevent spam.  
- *Threat Level 5:* These instances were observed to have spam for over two (2) days and the admins did not do anything against it. 

### Mute // Spam Ongoing

### Refederate with // Spam stopped

These instances had spam but since have taken action in order to stop it. If any other lists tell you to defederate from these instances, they're probably outdated.
